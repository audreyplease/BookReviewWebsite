# first-proj

Hi everyone!

I've begun my transitional period into developing my ind. project on here and can't wait to see where this takes me.
I'm hoping to delve deeper into my actual code soon...

On the other hand, mantis shrimp are so lucky
I'd give anything to have their color cones

I'm finally feeling better today
No more nausea!
Relieved
